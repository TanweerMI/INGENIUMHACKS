## STORYMAPPER

### INTRODUCTION AND AIM
Our project, StoryMapper, aims to bring people from around the world together. We came up with this idea to encourage people to step out of their homes and explore the area around them. The player can mark locations on the map provided in-game and write a note to accompany it. The note can be anything: a diary entree about their experience at that place, some interesting incident that occurred there or even a fictional story that other players can build upon to create their own fantasy world based on real-world locations. Players can discover other player's stories and markers and save them to their entree book. These stories can be accessed from the entree book anytime they want.

### PROBLEM SOLVED
Since the pandemic, people haven't been able to leave their homes frequently. Our app aims to foster positive community interactions and possibly help people befriend others. It also aims to foster imagination, making people turn their daily life's occurrences into epic fantastical story that others can build upon.

### WORKING
The app has to be downloaded onto an Android mobile phone. Turn on location permissions and network access. The map functions only in landscape mode; it HAS to be horizontal on startup; It will show the loading screen but not work if the orientation is either vertical or changed from vertical to horizontal during runtime. Click on the "Place marker" button to place a marker at your current location. You can pan around and to recenter back to your current location click on the "recenter" button. The coordinates displayed are the user's location, and pressing recenter will bring the centre of the screen to those coordinates. To switch between the entry book and maps, use the icons at the bottom of the screen. When a value on the entry book is pressed, the associated text can be displayed.
NOTE: Scripts are contained in the Assets Folder, along with all other code.

### USAGE OF THE BALSAMIQ PLATFORM (SPONSOR)
The platform was of great use to us in designing the UI/UX of the app as it provided wireframing functionality. It provided a way for us to envision the app collectively before working on it, saving a lot of time by preventing miscommunication while allowing us to take feedback from other people without difficulty in explaining. Considering the complexity of the project compared to what we've worked on in the past, because of the integration of maps, the Balsamiq platform provided considerable assistance to us.

### VIDEO EXPLANATION
There are two videos that have been submitted relating to the project. One of the videos shows the entry book associated with the markers, along with the process of setting up and saving markers. The other shows the interactive map running on an android device as an apk, showing the capability to recentre using geolocation.
