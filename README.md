# INGENIUMHACKS
(INSERT APP NAME)

OUR PROJECT
Our project, insertname, aims to bring people from around the world together. We came up with this idea to encourage people to step out of their homes and explore the area around them. The player can mark locations on the map provided in-game and write a note to accompany it. The note can be anything: a diary entree about their experience at that place, some interesting incident that occured there or even a fictional story that other players can build upon to create their own fantasy world based on real world locations. Players can discover other player's stories and markers and save them to their entree book. These stories can be accessed from the entree book anytime they want.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Since the pandemic, people haven't been able to leave their homes frequently. Our app aims to foster positive community interactions and possibly help people befriend others. It also aims to foster imagination, making people turn their daily life occurences into an epic fantasical story that others can build upon.

WORKING
The app has to be downloaded onto an android mobile phone. Turn location permissions and network access on.The maps functions only in landscape mode; Phone has to be horizontal before opening the app. Click on "Place marker" button to place a marker at your current location. You can pan around and zoom in and out, and to recenter back to your current location, click on the "recenter" button. To switch between the entree book and maps, use the icons at the bottom of the screen.
